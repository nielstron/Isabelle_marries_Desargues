\<^item> We introduce the types of 'point and 'line and an incidence relation between them.
\<^item> A set of axioms for the (3-dimensional) projective space. 
An alternative set of axioms could use planes as basic objects in addition to 'point and 'line

  (* One has a type of 'point *)
  (* We don't need an axiom for the existence of at least one point, 
  since we know that the type "'point" is not empty  
  TODO: why would that be true? *)
  (* One has a type of 'line *)
  (* There is a relation of incidence between 'point and 'line *)

  assumes meet_def:  "(incid (meet l m) l \<and> incid (meet l m) m)"

  (* The relation of incidence is decidable *)
  assumes incid_dec: "(incid P l) \<or> \<not>(incid P l)"

  (* Ax1: Any two distinct 'point are incident with just one line *)
  assumes ax1_existence: "\<exists>l. (incid P l) \<and> (incid M l)"
  assumes ax1_uniqueness: "(incid P k) \<longrightarrow> (incid M k) \<longrightarrow> (incid P l) \<longrightarrow> (incid M l) \<longrightarrow> (P = M) \<or> (k = l)"


  (* Ax2: If A B C D are four distinct 'point such that AB meets CD then AC meets BD.
  Sometimes this is called Pasch's axiom, but according to Wikipedia it is misleading
  since Pasch's axiom refers to something else. *)
  assumes ax2: "distinct4 A B C D \<longrightarrow> (incid A lAB \<and> incid B lAB) 
  \<longrightarrow> (incid C lCD \<and> incid D lCD) \<longrightarrow> (incid A lAC \<and> incid C lAC) \<longrightarrow> 
  (incid B lBD \<and> incid D lBD) \<longrightarrow> (\<exists>I.(incid I lAB \<and> incid I lCD)) \<longrightarrow> 
  (\<exists>J.(incid J lAC \<and> incid J lBD))"



  (** Dimension-related axioms **)
  (* Ax3: Every line is incident with at least three 'point.
  As I understand it, this axiom makes sure that 'line are not degenerated into 'point
  and since it asks for three distinct 'point, not only 2, it captures the idea that
  'line are continuous, i.e. there is always a point between two distinct 'point. *)
  assumes ax3: "\<exists>A B C. distinct3 A B C \<and> (incid A l) \<and> (incid B l) \<and> (incid C l)"

  (* Ax4: There exists two 'line that do not meet, 
  hence the geometry is at least 3-dimensional *)
  assumes ax4: "\<exists>l m.\<forall>P. \<not>(incid P l \<and> incid P m)"


  (* Ax5: The geometry is not 4-dimensional, hence it is exactly 3-dimensional *)
  assumes ax5: "distinct3 l1 l2 l3 \<longrightarrow> (\<exists>l4 J1 J2 J3. distinct3 J1 J2 J3 \<and> 
  meet l1 l4 = J1 \<and> meet l2 l4 = J2 \<and> meet l3 l4 = J3)"
